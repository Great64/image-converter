# Image Converter

Never trusted the ones on the web so I decided to make my own. It was made in about an hour so it's nothing too special but it gets the job done.

## Setup

The link in this repository deactivates if there are no visitors for a while. Luckily setting this up is really easy:

cd image_converter
```

2. Install dependencies:
